# JPG-PNG-JPEGtoAVI

I've finally wrote the code of my pictures-to-movie python script. It works nicely !
So how does it work ? Simply follow the instruction by the program, and then select the directory containing all of your pictures just after rendering them in chaotica. They have to be same size, and ordered (as they'll be after Chaotica render's). Select the directory, and let the program create the movie for you ! :slight_smile: You can choose the number of fps you want, which will of course adjust the lenght of the final movie.

It becomes super simple to make animation with ur chaotica's frames, so no need to upload them on any video editing software
I can give an explanation of how the script works if needed, contact me :slight_smile: I'll soon make a commit to transform the py script to a .exe file so you won't even need python to load it

It is using OpenCV and OS

You will need to install OpenCV for python with command : 

pip install opencv-python
